The following files are included:
* lab1b-client.c is the source file for the client program
* lab1b-server.c is the source file for the server program
* Makefile builds the program, creates the tarball, and cleans the working directory
* README documents the included files and other info

I used the Linux man pages as reference for many of the system calls, such as socket(7). I additionally referred to
https://web.archive.org/web/20200223023534/http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/socket.html for a tutorial
on socket usage, and https://www.zlib.net/zlib_how.html for a tutorial on zlib usage.

My basic testing procedure involved checking functionality with and without the --compress flag as well as with and
without the --log flag. In testing these flags, I ensured that input sent from the client was echoed back as expected
from the shell. I also checked that input from the server was properly compressed down to a lower size with the 
--compress flag by comparing the log files of a session with the --compress flag and of a session without the 
--compress flag. I validated correct behavior on inputs of ^D and ^C from the client as well as read errors from the 
client. Lastly, I used and referred to the sanity script to test for basic functionality of my program.
