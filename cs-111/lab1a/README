The following files are included:
* lab1a.c is the C source module
* Makefile builds the program, creates the tarball, and cleans the working directory
* README documents the included files and other info

I used the Linux man pages as reference for many of the system calls, such as pipe(2), kill(3), and
execv(3). I referred to the GNU libc manual for an example of setting the terminal to noncanonical 
mode (https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Noncanon-Example.html).I also used the GNU 
libc manual on WTERMSIG and WEXITSTATUS, which was used for the shell status printout
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Process-Completion-Status.html). Lastly, I 
looked up how to register a function to be called at process termination for restoring the terminal
mode, which led me to atexit(3) in the Linux man pages 
(https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atexit.3.html).

For testing without the --shell flag, I made sure that input from the keyboard was properly 
outputted to the terminal, with input like ^C being ignored. I also tested for proper handling of 
CR and LF. For testing with the --shell flag, I entered several bash commands like echo and ls and
checked for the proper output in the terminal. I also checked for proper handling of ^C as an
interrupt signal to the shell to any process I started in the shell, and for proper handling of
^D in terminating the program. I also referred to the sanity check script for its tests for basic
functionality.
