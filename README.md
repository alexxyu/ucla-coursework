# UCLA Coursework

This repo houses code from classes that I took during my undergraduate studies at UCLA!

Originally, I had (about) one repo per class, but I decided to [merge](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39345348) them all into one neat repo here, with all of the git history preserved!

## Other projects

Some of my coursework involved group projects that can be found in other repos:
* CS 97: [Projector](https://github.com/CS97-Projector/Projector)
* CS 130: [TeleTale](https://github.com/ColeTrammer/TeleTale)
* ECE C147: [EEG Classifier](https://github.com/matthewyu01/eeg-classifier)
