The following files are included:
* lab0.c: the C source module
* Makefile that builds the program, creates the tarball, and tests the program
* Two screenshots of a gdb session inspecting a forced segfault
* README that documents the included files, test cases, and other info

The following smoke-test cases were included in the check target:
* simple_case checks that the program works correctly reading from standard 
input and writing to standard output
* infile_case checks that the program works correctly reading from a specified 
input file
* outfile_case checks that the program works correctly writing to a specified 
output file
* segfault_case checks that the program catches a segfault and exits with the
correct exit code
* badarg_case checks that the program correctly handles an unrecognized 
argument and exits with the correct exit code
* bad_infile_case checks that the program correctly handles a nonexistant
specified input file and exits with the correct exit code

The Linux man pages to research and study the different operations like 
open(2), creat(2), and close(2). I looked up how to compare files in order to
create the smoke-test cases, which led me to the reference pages on the cmp
command.
