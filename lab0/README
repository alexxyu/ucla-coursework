The following files are included:
* lab0.c is the C source module
* Makefile builds the program, creates the tarball, tests the program, and
cleans the current directory
* Two screenshots, backtrace.png and breakpoint.png, of a gdb session inspecting 
a forced segfault
* README documents the included files, test cases, and other info
* check.sh contains the smoke-test cases that tests for basic functionality of 
the program

The following smoke-test cases were included in check.sh:
* simple case checks that the program works correctly reading from standard 
input and writing to standard output and exits with the correct exit code
* infile case checks that the program works correctly reading from a specified 
input file and exits with the correct exit code
* outfile case checks that the program works correctly writing to a specified 
output file and exits with the correct exit code
* segfault case checks that the program catches a segfault and exits with the
correct exit code and exits with the correct exit code
* badarg case checks that the program correctly handles an unrecognized 
argument and exits with the correct exit code
* bad infile case checks that the program correctly handles a nonexistant
specified input file and exits with the correct exit code

The Linux man pages to research and study the different operations like 
open(2), creat(2), and close(2). I also looked up getopt_long(3) from the
Linux man page (https://linux.die.net/man/3/getopt_long) and used the 
provided example as a reference for usage. I also looked up how to compare 
files in order to create the smoke-test cases, which led me to the Linux 
man page on the cmp command.
