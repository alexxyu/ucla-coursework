1. The latest merge not newer that 2015-01-25 shows a mergepoint of the master
branch into xwidget.

The upper subwindow gives a graphical representation of the branches and 
also provides commit information such as the commit message, the committer, 
and the commit time. The bottom left subwindow allows you to view the diff
between files, the old version of a file, and the new version of the file. The
bottom right subwindow allows you to navigate changed files as well as the 
entire tree structure of the files.

2. The difference between my repository and the one in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
is two comments. The single 'l' in "signaled" and "signaling" was changed to
double 'l's in these two comments.
