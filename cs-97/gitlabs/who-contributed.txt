I used the git log command with the -S flag, which searches for commits that
added or removed the given string. After that, I then used the same command
and added the -p flag, which shows the diff in the commit, which allowed me to
figure out where exactly the string was introduced.

From my investigation, I found that the commit that introduced this statement 
was authored by Arthur David Olson on December 21, 1995 with the commit
message "Eggert changes". Upon examination of the diff, the statement is part of
a comment from Paul Eggert, dated December 19, 1995 as a quote from Thomas G. 
Shanks about timekeeping in Indiana.
