The following files are included:
* lab3a.c is the C source file for the filesystem analyzer
* ext2_fs.h is a header file that defines constants and structs about the EXT2 filesystem
* Makefile provides targets to build the program, clean the working directory, and create the deliverable tarball
* README documents the included files and reference materials

We used http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html and discussion slides as reference for the EXT2 filesystem structure.

For testing, we compared the output of the program when given trivial.img against the provided trivial.csv. We also 
tested for appropriate error messages when given erroneous arguments. We also checked for reasonableness in the 
program's output when given EXT2_test.img.
