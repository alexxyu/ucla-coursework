The following files are included:
* lab4c_tcp.c is the C source file for the temperature sampling application that connects to the TCP logging server
* lab4c_tls.c is the C source file for the temperature sampling application that connects to the TLS logging server
* Makefile provides targets to build the program, create the tarball, and clean the current working directory
* README documents the listed files and other information about development

I used the following as references:
* https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/ for documentation on the OpenSSL library
* TA discussion slides for a useful guide on the lab

Testing involved connecting the applications to the TCP logging server and the TLS logging server and checking for 
appropriate log messages. I also used the sanity script to check for functionality of the applications.
