The following files are included:
* lab4b.c is the C source file for the temperature sampling application
* Makefile provides targets to build the program, create the tarball, clean the current working directory, and run a 
basic smoke test
* test.sh is a shell script that performs a basic smoke test of the program
* README documents the listed files and other information about development

The following were used as reference in building the application:
* https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature_Sensor_V1.2/ for documentation on the temperature sensor
* https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/ for usage of the MRAA library
* https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6dyEb8VXZo-N3hVcVI0UFpWSVk for example usage of GPIO
* TA discussion slides for general helpful advice and guidance, particularly on creating a DUMMY option

The smoke test checks for basic functionality of the program, particularly the --log option and the ability to enter
specified commands (LOG, STOP, START, OFF) that perform particular actions.
