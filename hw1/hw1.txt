Homework 1 after-action report:

I chose my approach to the filter reachable rules problem because it is relatively straightforward and familiar in its
methodology. It is essentially a breadth-first search to find the connected component of a graph consisting of the 
nonterminal symbols as nodes and the rules as edges. This was also influenced by discussions about the problem during
discussion section. Starting from the start symbol, my algorithm finds the set of all reachable nonterminal symbols and
then returns the rules whose LHS is a symbol from this set.

A slightly different approach that I considered was to create the filtered list of rules during the recursive process, 
but I realized that this method would not necessarily preserve the original order of the rules. Thus, I modified my 
approach to find the reachable nonterminal symbols first before filtering the list of rules at the end.
